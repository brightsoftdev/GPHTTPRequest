Welcome to the GPHTTPRequest wiki!

# GPHTTPRequest
Simple and amazing HTTP networking library for iOS and Mac OSX. It's built on top of NSURLConnection, NSOperation, and other familiar Foundation technologies. The API set is simple,fast, and robust to use (I might even dare to say fun!). The goal of this library was to provide a natural and powerful way to interact with RESTful web services, while still maintaining simplicity of the code. Examples on how to use the framework can be found here:

# Requirements

This framework requires at least iOS 4/Mac OSX 10.5 and above. Xcode 4 is recommend. A static library and framework are provided for simplicity and avoid importing extra files.
